# ML_first_steps
You can find some basic study projects for ML. Most common libraries: pandas, sklearn, matplotlib.\
The projects: CatnDogs, Iris_dec_tree and Titanic are done the same way. Most revealing of them is a Titanic dataset.\
Interesting things that you can find: cross validation for training and finding max_depth for Decision Tree, calculation precision and recall scores, ROC AUC.

# Video_Game_Sales
The project "Video_Game_Sales" shows my analytic and visualization skills. Also you will find some data clearing/transformation and features creation (converting 'string' columns to 'int' and 'bool') for model training.

Most common libraries: pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn.\
The chosen  models: LinearRegression, RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor
